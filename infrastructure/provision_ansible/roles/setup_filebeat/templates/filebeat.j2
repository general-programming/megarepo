######################## Filebeat Configuration ############################

# This file is a full configuration example documenting all non-deprecated
# options in comments. For a shorter configuration example, that contains only
# the most common options, please see filebeat.yml in the same directory.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/index.html


#==========================  Modules configuration =============================
filebeat.modules:

#-------------------------------- System Module --------------------------------
- module: system
  # Syslog
  syslog:
    enabled: true

    # Set custom paths for the log files. If left empty,
    # Filebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.
    #var.paths:

    # Convert the timestamp to UTC. Requires Elasticsearch >= 6.1.
    var.convert_timezone: true

    # Input configuration (advanced). Any input configuration option
    # can be added under this section.
    #input:

  # Authorization logs
  auth:
    enabled: true

    # Set custom paths for the log files. If left empty,
    # Filebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.

    # can be added under this section.
    #input:

#------------------------------ PostgreSQL Module ------------------------------
- module: postgresql
  # Logs
  log:
    enabled: true

#=========================== Filebeat inputs =============================

# List of inputs to fetch data.
filebeat.inputs:
# Each - is an input. Most options can be set at the input level, so
# you can use different inputs for various configurations.
# Below are the input specific configurations.

# Type of the files. Based on this the way the file is read is decided.
# The different types cannot be mixed in one input
#
# Possible options are:
# * log: Reads every line of the log file (default)
# * stdin: Reads the standard in

#------------------------------ Log input --------------------------------
- type: log

  # Change to true to enable this input configuration.
  enabled: true

  # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
  # To fetch all ".log" files from a specific level of subdirectories
  # /var/log/*/*.log can be used.
  # For each file found under this path, a harvester is started.
  # Make sure not file is defined twice as this can lead to unexpected behaviour.
  paths:
    - /var/log/messages
    - /var/log/dmesg
    - /var/log/**/*.log

#========================= Filebeat global options ============================

# Registry data path. If a relative path is used, it is considered relative to the
# data path.
#filebeat.registry.path: ${path.data}/registry

# The permissions mask to apply on registry data, and meta files. The default
# value is 0600.  Must be a valid Unix-style file permissions mask expressed in
# octal notation.  This option is not supported on Windows.
#filebeat.registry.file_permissions: 0600

# The timeout value that controls when registry entries are written to disk
# (flushed). When an unwritten update exceeds this value, it triggers a write
# to disk. When flush is set to 0s, the registry is written to disk after each
# batch of events has been published successfully. The default value is 0s.
#filebeat.registry.flush: 0s


# Starting with Filebeat 7.0, the registry uses a new directory format to store
# Filebeat state. After you upgrade, Filebeat will automatically migrate a 6.x
# registry file to use the new directory format. If you changed
# filebeat.registry.path while upgrading, set filebeat.registry.migrate_file to
# point to the old registry file.
#filebeat.registry.migrate_file: ${path.data}/registry

# By default Ingest pipelines are not updated if a pipeline with the same ID
# already exists. If this option is enabled Filebeat overwrites pipelines
# everytime a new Elasticsearch connection is established.
#filebeat.overwrite_pipelines: false

# How long filebeat waits on shutdown for the publisher to finish.
# Default is 0, not waiting.
#filebeat.shutdown_timeout: 0

# Enable filebeat config reloading
#filebeat.config:
  #inputs:
    #enabled: false
    #path: inputs.d/*.yml
    #reload.enabled: true
    #reload.period: 10s
  #modules:
    #enabled: false
    #path: modules.d/*.yml
    #reload.enabled: true
    #reload.period: 10s

#================================ General ======================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
# If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
# logical properties.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output. Fields can be scalar values, arrays, dictionaries, or any nested
# combination of these.
#fields:
#  env: staging

# If this option is set to true, the custom fields are stored as top-level
# fields in the output document instead of being grouped under a fields
# sub-dictionary. Default is false.
#fields_under_root: false

# Internal queue configuration for buffering events to be published.
#queue:
  # Queue type by name (default 'mem')
  # The memory queue will present all available events (up to the outputs
  # bulk_max_size) to the output, the moment the output is ready to server
  # another batch of events.
  #mem:
    # Max number of events the queue can buffer.
    #events: 4096

    # Hints the minimum number of events stored in the queue,
    # before providing a batch of events to the outputs.
    # The default value is set to 2048.
    # A value of 0 ensures events are immediately available
    # to be sent to the outputs.
    #flush.min_events: 2048

    # Maximum duration after which events are available to the outputs,
    # if the number of events stored in the queue is < min_flush_events.
    #flush.timeout: 1s

  # The spool queue will store events in a local spool file, before
  # forwarding the events to the outputs.
  #
  # Beta: spooling to disk is currently a beta feature. Use with care.
  #
  # The spool file is a circular buffer, which blocks once the file/buffer is full.
  # Events are put into a write buffer and flushed once the write buffer
  # is full or the flush_timeout is triggered.
  # Once ACKed by the output, events are removed immediately from the queue,
  # making space for new events to be persisted.
  #spool:
    # The file namespace configures the file path and the file creation settings.
    # Once the file exists, the `size`, `page_size` and `prealloc` settings
    # will have no more effect.
    #file:
      # Location of spool file. The default value is ${path.data}/spool.dat.
      #path: "${path.data}/spool.dat"

      # Configure file permissions if file is created. The default value is 0600.
      #permissions: 0600

      # File size hint. The spool blocks, once this limit is reached. The default value is 100 MiB.
      #size: 100MiB

      # The files page size. A file is split into multiple pages of the same size. The default value is 4KiB.
      #page_size: 4KiB

      # If prealloc is set, the required space for the file is reserved using
      # truncate. The default value is true.
      #prealloc: true

    # Spool writer settings
    # Events are serialized into a write buffer. The write buffer is flushed if:
    # - The buffer limit has been reached.
    # - The configured limit of buffered events is reached.
    # - The flush timeout is triggered.
    #write:
      # Sets the write buffer size.
      #buffer_size: 1MiB

      # Maximum duration after which events are flushed if the write buffer
      # is not full yet. The default value is 1s.
      #flush.timeout: 1s

      # Number of maximum buffered events. The write buffer is flushed once the
      # limit is reached.
      #flush.events: 16384

      # Configure the on-disk event encoding. The encoding can be changed
      # between restarts.
      # Valid encodings are: json, ubjson, and cbor.
      #codec: cbor
    #read:
      # Reader flush timeout, waiting for more events to become available, so
      # to fill a complete batch as required by the outputs.
      # If flush_timeout is 0, all available events are forwarded to the
      # outputs immediately.
      # The default value is 0s.
      #flush.timeout: 0s

# Sets the maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously. The
# default is the number of logical CPUs available in the system.
#max_procs:

#================================ Outputs ======================================

#-------------------------- Elasticsearch output -------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Boolean flag to enable or disable the output module.
  enabled: true

  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
